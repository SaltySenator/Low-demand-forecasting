Hi my name is Kasimir Harris-Wilson, and I am a graduate student enrolled to Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am currently doing my Master's thesis for the program data science & marketing analytics
and I am currently looking data for my paper on spare parts forecasting. I am kindly asking you to share your data with me for my research. I want to clarify that it is 
for academic purposes only.

You may contact under the following e-mail: kasimirharriswilson@gmail.com Alternativaely, you can reach me with my student e-mail: 603046kh@eur.nl

Kind regards,

Kasimir
